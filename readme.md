## Overview

This is an in-progress repository for a simple phonebook written in TypeScript for the Node.js environment. It uses the `readline` module for reading user inputs and the `fs` module for interacting with the computer's file system.

## How to Use It

To use this program, you need to install the following packages:

1. TypeScript
2. @types/node
3. ts-node
4. nodemon

> **Note: These packages should be installed automatically after you clone the project, but if you have problems running the app, check these packages in the `package-lock.json` file.**

Finally, you can start the program by running this command: `npm start`
